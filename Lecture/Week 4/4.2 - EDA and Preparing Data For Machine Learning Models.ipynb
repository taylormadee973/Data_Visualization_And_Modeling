    "# Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It allows you to understand the data, get a sense of the structure, relationships between variables, identify outliers, detect anomalies, test hypothesis, or check assumptions related to a specific model.  It's an important step on the way to doing machine learning."

    "### History of EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" was coined by John W. Tukey in the 1970s. Tukey played a significant role in developing the field of statistics. He highlighted the importance of using a more visual approach in analyzing datasets, rather than focusing primarily on traditional statistical methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "In his pioneering work, \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" (1977), Tukey proposed that data analysis should begin by exploring the data, rather than by confirming a hypothesis. He introduced various graphical techniques, like the box plot and stem-and-leaf plot, as well as other methods that allow analysts to visualize and understand the underlying structure of their data."

    "### Importance of EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Data Distribution**: Before applying any ML model, you need to understand the distribution of your data. Some algorithms make assumptions about the distribution of your data, such as linear regression assuming that the residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**: EDA can reveal insights that guide the transformation or creation of new features to improve the performance of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detecting Outliers**: Outliers can skew statistical measures and are typically removed or adjusted for before modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Cleaning**: EDA can help in spotting missing or erroneous data. Clean data is crucial for the success of a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Choosing the Right Model**: Some patterns in the data can help decide if a linear model, time-series model, clustering algorithm, etc., might be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Validating Assumptions**: Many models have underlying assumptions. For example, if you're planning to use methods that assume a linear relationship between variables, it's good to verify this assumption through EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Reducing Overfitting**: By understanding the actual relationships and patterns in data, we can create models that generalize better. If we build models without understanding these relationships, we risk overfitting to noise or outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA before Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing EDA before modeling in machine learning is crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improving Model Performance**: Understanding the nature of your data can lead to better feature selection and, consequently, better model performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: EDA can prevent you from going down dead-end paths or making erroneous decisions based on misconceptions about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Storytelling**: A key aspect of data science and analytics is the ability to convey a story. EDA allows you to understand this story before moving to modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trustworthiness**: By performing EDA, you assure stakeholders that the data was thoroughly inspected before any models were built, lending credibility to your findings.\n"

    "### 2. Check for missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it important to check for missing data?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Compatibility:** Many machine learning algorithms can't handle missing values and will throw an error if you try to fit them with data containing NaN values. You will experience the classic \"Input contains NaN\" error if you've forgotten this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Quality and Integrity:** Missing data can be an indication of a broader problem with the data collection, processing, or storage processes. Before training any model, it's essential to ensure that the data's quality is up to the mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Biased Results:** Missing values, if not handled properly, can introduce bias in ML models. This can be especially the case if data is not missing completely at random. For instance, if certain types of observations are more likely to have missing data than others, models trained on such data can lead to biased predictions or interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Performance:** Improper handling of missing values can degrade the model's performance. If missing values are replaced with a constant value without much thought, the variance and relationship dynamics of the data can be altered, leading to poorer model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss of Valuable Information:** Simply removing rows or columns with missing values can lead to a significant loss of information. Before deciding on such a step, it's essential to evaluate the potential impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Engineering:** Handling missing values often requires an understanding of the domain and the specific features. Sometimes, the fact that a value is missing can itself be informative. Creating an additional binary \"indicator\" feature that denotes whether a value was missing can sometimes add predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational Efficiency:** Some methods of handling missing values, like model-based imputation, can be computationally expensive. It's important to be aware of missing values early on to allocate resources efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Metrics:** Like outliers, missing values, if not addressed properly, can distort evaluation metrics. This can mislead the model selection and evaluation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Interpretability:** Missing values can make it challenging to interpret a model's behavior, especially if different features have missing data in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Assumptions:** Some algorithms, like those used for imputation (e.g., regression imputation), make assumptions about the nature of the data. Missing values can violate these assumptions and impact the integrity of the imputation process."

    "We've talked some different ways to print the number of missing values using Pandas (`.info()`, `.isnull().sum()`).  However, sometimes it's important to understand not only how much data is missing but how missing data is distributed.  Are only a few individuals missing a lot of data?  Or is the missing data sprinkled throughout the entire dataset? \n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better understanding of how missing data in our data, we can use a new visualization called the msno.matrix function from the missingno library is used to create a \"nullity matrix\" of your data.  Here's a breakdown of what the nullity matrix does and how to interpret it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical Representation: The nullity matrix provides a binary, graphical representation of your dataset, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The light (often white) lines or blocks represent missing values.\n",
    "* The dark (often black) lines or blocks represent non-missing (filled) values.\n",
    "* Columns: Each column of the matrix corresponds to a column in your DataFrame. If you see a column with many white lines, it means that this column has a significant amount of missing data.\n",
    "* Rows: Each row of the matrix corresponds to a row in your DataFrame. If a row has many white blocks, it means that this particular row has many missing values.\n",
    "* Data Density: On the right side of the matrix, you might notice a sparkline-style mini plot. This plot provides a summarized view of the data completeness for each row. Rows at the top of the matrix with more dark blocks will have a higher line on the sparkline than rows at the bottom with more missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visual representation is beneficial because it quickly gives you an overview of where you're missing data and how much.  Patterns in missing data can be indicative of a structured problem in the data collection process. For instance, if you notice that two columns are always missing data together, it might indicate an issue you weren't aware of.\n"
